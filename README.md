# Structured-Review-of-Machine-Learning-Control-of-Lower-Limb-Exoskeletons
Lower limb exoskeletons are a maturing technology with the potential to reshape mobility by enhancing safety, accessibility, efficiency and convenience of locomotion. The objective of this paper is to survey the current state of the art of machine learning based control of lower-limb exoskeletons. A selection of proposed techniques is reviewed along with a discussion of their effectiveness. The surveyed approaches differ in the output variables from the machine learning algorithms used to control the exoskeletons. The side by side comparison presented in this survey helps to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of the reviewed approaches and assist with system level design choices.

## Evaluation Criteria
Once the studies for this review were selected based on the above criteria, the authors evaluated them based on six additional criteria. Each received a 1 for passing and 0 for not passing, with the exception of sample size which also included a 0.5 value. 
- Sample size
- Sample Population
- Number of activities the exoskeleton could perform
- Real-time/ Dynamic motion adaptation
- Model accuracy
- Generalizability

Each technique outlined below is presented through a radar chart, assessing it against the six criteria mentioned earlier. A more rounded radar chart indicates a higher level of readiness for the specific technique for clinical trials.
